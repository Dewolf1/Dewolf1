## Hi — I'm Mohd Adeeb
I build production-quality web applications with Python (Flask / Django) and ship full-stack projects from idea to deployment. I enjoy working on web platforms, automation tools, and practical ML/vision projects. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science (3rd year).

- 🔭 I’m currently improving BlogIt (Flask blog platform) and contributing to open-source projects.
- 🌱 Learning advanced web deployment, containerization, and scalable backend patterns.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Flask, Django, YOLOv5, or deploying apps to free hosting platforms.
